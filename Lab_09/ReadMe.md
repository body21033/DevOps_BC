# HomeTask_09 - Jenkins (GitHub + Telegram)


## Requirements:
 - Setup Jenkins on server;
 - Create Multibranch pipeline and connect it with the Gitlab/Github project repository with the Jenkinsfile;
 - Jenkinsfile should have several stages: build, tests, notification (telegram bot, etc.);
 - [Optional] Use branch conditions, vars, etc;
 - [Optional] Create script for automated Jenkins setup (with user, plugins).

## Preparation:
 - First you need to download [Visual Studio Code][1] ;
 - Next, you need to create an ETC-2 on [AWS];
 - Then make a bash-script with commands about running Jenkins with some plugins and run it;
 - Your Jenkins will have an ETC-2 Public Address + :8080 (port);
 - Use standart Login / Pass = `admin / admin` (but It`s better if you change it to more secure information);
 -
